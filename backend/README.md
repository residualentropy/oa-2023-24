# Backend

The backend is hosted on replit. Given the limited time window, I opted to deploy it this way instead of with a dedicated provider like render. 
The differences between the replit and other providers of a place to run your backend aren't particularly significant at this scale anyway. 
This code is in no way replit-specific, that's just where I'm hosting it now.
