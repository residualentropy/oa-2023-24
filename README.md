# DSSD 2023-2024 Admissions Assessment

This repository has starter code that you will build on to show your skills as a developer. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/DSSD-Madison/oa-2023-24/fork) to get started on your own copy.

Currently, the repository contains some frontend code for a webpage with some graphs that are populated with random data.

**Your job:** Populate the graphs with real data.

Your "real data" can come from anywhere: a file that you find on something like [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), an enterprise API, Google BigQuery, etc. We will be more impressed with types of data sources that are more practical and/or prevalent in industry.

Make sure to update the webpage to explain the data that your graphs are populated with

Bonus points if (but not only if):
- your graphs update in real time
- there is secondary processing on the data i.e. you are creating new insights on the data
  - the more advanced the data science technique, the more impressed we will be
- you improve the visual appeal of the webpage
- you deploy the webpage and include the live url somewhere that we'll see it
