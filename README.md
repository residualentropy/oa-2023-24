# DSSD 2023-2024 Admissions Assessment

This repository has starter code that you will build on to show your skills as a developer. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/DSSD-Madison/oa-2023-24/fork) to get started on your own copy.

Currently, the repository contains some frontend code for a webpage with a graph populated with mock data recieved from a backend server.

**Your job:** Populate the graphs with real data.

Your "real data" can come from anywhere: a file that you find on something like [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), an enterprise API, Google BigQuery, etc. We will be more impressed with types of data sources that are more practical and/or prevalent in industry.

To do this, either modify the sample Express.js backend, or create a new backend in your language/framework of your choice.

Make sure to update the webpage to explain the data that your graphs are populated with.

Ways to go above and beyond:
- make your graph update in real time
- apply some secondary processing on the data i.e. create new insights on the data
  - the more advanced the data science technique, the more impressed we will be
- improve the visual appeal of the webpage
- deploy your backend
